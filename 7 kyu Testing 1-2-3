Your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked with implementing the line numbering.

Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number.

The numbering starts at 1. The format is n: string. Notice the colon and space in between.

Examples: (Input --> Output)

[] --> []
["a", "b", "c"] --> ["1: a", "2: b", "3: c"]

function number(lines) {
  // Use map() to iterate over each element in the lines array
  // The callback function provided to map() receives two arguments:
  // line (the current element) and index (the index of the current element)
  return lines.map((line, index) => {
    // For each line, return a new string that combines the line number (index + 1),
    // a colon, a space, and the original line content
    // The line number starts at 1, so we add 1 to the index (which starts at 0)
    return `${index + 1}: ${line}`;
  });
}
