For every good kata idea there seem to be quite a few bad ones!

In this kata you need to check the provided array (x) for good ideas 'good' and bad ideas 'bad'. If there are one or two good ideas, return 'Publish!', if there are more than 2 return 'I smell a series!'. If there are no good ideas, as is often the case, return 'Fail!'.

function well(x) {
  // Count the number of 'good' ideas in the array.
  const goodIdeas = x.filter(idea => idea === 'good').length;

  // Return the appropriate response based on the count of 'good' ideas.
  if (goodIdeas > 2) {
    return 'I smell a series!';
  } else if (goodIdeas >= 1) {
    return 'Publish!';
  } else {
    return 'Fail!';
  }
}
